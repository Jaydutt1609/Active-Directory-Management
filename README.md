# Active Directory-Centric Network Infrastructure Deployment and Management

## Project Overview

This project involves the deployment and management of an Active Directory-centric network infrastructure for centralized resource control. The implementation ensures security and standardization for over 200 users while managing shared data effectively.

## Key Features

- **Active Directory Management**  
  Managed an Active Directory domain for centralized user account creation and group policy enforcement, ensuring security and standardization for 200+ users.

- **Network Configuration**  
  Configured DHCP with failover, DNS with DNSSEC, and set up FTP/NFS services on Active Directory for efficient file sharing and storage, managing over 2TB of shared data.

- **Web Hosting**  
  Implemented Internet Information Services (IIS) for web hosting with SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring secure connections to the hosted website.

- **Disaster Recovery Procedures**  
  Enforced security measures and tested disaster recovery procedures through regular Active Directory backups, achieving 99.9% uptime.

## Technologies Used

- Active Directory
- DHCP with Failover
- DNS with DNSSEC
- FTP/NFS Services
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- SSL/TLS for secure web hosting

## Installation

To replicate the Active Directory-centric network infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jaydutt1609/Active-Directory-Management
2. **Set Up Active Directory**
   - Configure the Active Directory domain and create user accounts.
   - Establish group policies for security and standardization.
3. **Configure Network Services**
   - Set up DHCP with failover and DNS with DNSSEC.
   - Configure FTP/NFS services for file sharing and storage.
4. **Install IIS for Web Hosting**
   - Set up IIS and configure SSL/TLS for secure web hosting.
5. **Implement Disaster Recovery Procedures**
   - Schedule regular Active Directory backups to ensure uptime.
## Usage
  - The network infrastructure is designed to support a centralized management system for user accounts and resources.
  - Access to shared data can be managed through the configured FTP/NFS services.
